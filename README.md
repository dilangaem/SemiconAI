# semiconAI
This project contains a metal/non-metal classifier developed using random forest algorithms for computationally discovering new semiconductor materials. Our work is reported in detail in the following publication.

[### Generative Design of Stable Semiconductor Materials Using Deep Learning And DFT](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/61d08f7275c57229dbff6255)

**Under construction**

## Prerequisites
- python 3.7
- pandas 1.3.0
- numpy 1.21.0
- sklearn 1.0.0
- scipy 1.5.q 

It is highly recomending to use a python environment to use our code
